## Data 
Passive Acoustic Data was collected from NOAA's GCP. Data comes from the ADEON Project which is an integrated network of deep water observatories across U.S (mid - and south atlantic outer continental shelf).
Audio data, metadata and documents specifically for this take were from this platform 'adeon/audio/ble/adeon_ble_amar384.1-2-3-4.16/' in which I used a subset of the .flac files

Pipeline
- convert .flac to raw uncompressed .wav files (preprocessing step)
- convert raw .wav into MFCC features (or spectrograms)
  - 2D vector array of time and feature - treat as a sequence of feature vectors like a spectrogram "image"
- Use a CNN based architecture
  - Treat MFCCs/spectrograms as 2D images
  - CNNs learn local patterns (e.g. harmonic, formants) for audio classification
  - ResNet, Yolo or lightweight MobileNet (yolo-tiny) for edge deployment
Or use a Transformers (e.g. AST) to handle long-rage dependencies but heavier computational requirements
Or use RRNs treat the MFCCs as a time series of feature vectors - good for handling temporal dynamics matter (event detection)

Decision reasoning:
I preprocess raw .wav files into MFCCs and spectrograms. These 2D feature representations are well‑suited for convolutional neural networks, which can learn local spectral patterns. For tasks requiring temporal modeling, I would extend this with recurrent layers or consider transformer architectures. For deployment, I would prioritize lightweight CNNs to balance accuracy and efficiency.
